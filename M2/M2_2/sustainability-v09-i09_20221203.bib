ABSTRACT = {The purpose of this paper is to recommend a break-even point for the capital investment cost for a Sodium-cooled Fast Reactor (SFR) when choosing between a Pyro-SFR nuclear fuel cycle (recycling option via Pyro-processing) and a direct disposal option. This is because the selection of an alternative cannot be justified without a guarantee of economic feasibility. The calculation of a break-even point is necessary because SFR capital investment cost makes up the largest share of the cost for electricity generation. In other words, the cost of capital investment is an important cost driver, and the one that exerts the greatest effect on Pyro-SFR nuclear fuel cycle economics. In the end, the break-even point of the SFR capital investment cost between the Pyro-SFR nuclear fuel cycle and the direct disposal was calculated to be 4284 US$/kWe. In other words, it is possible to claim that the potential for the economic viability of the Pyro-SFR nuclear fuel cycle is greater (compared to investing in direct disposal) when the SFR capital investment cost is 4284 US$/kWe or less. In addition, Pyro-SFR technology will enable sustainable nuclear power generation.},
