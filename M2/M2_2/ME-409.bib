	abstract = {The existing literature on the construction costs of nuclear power reactors has focused almost exclusively on trends in construction costs in only two countries, the United States and France, and during two decades, the 1970s and 1980s. These analyses, Koomey and Hultman (2007); Grubler (2010), and Escobar-Rangel and Lévêque (2015), study only 26\% of reactors built globally between 1960 and 2010, providing an incomplete picture of the economic evolution of nuclear power construction. This study curates historical reactor-specific overnight construction cost ({OCC}) data that broaden the scope of study substantially, covering the full cost history for 349 reactors in the {US}, France, Canada, West Germany, Japan, India, and South Korea, encompassing 58\% of all reactors built globally. We find that trends in costs have varied significantly in magnitude and in structure by era, country, and experience. In contrast to the rapid cost escalation that characterized nuclear construction in the United States, we find evidence of much milder cost escalation in many countries, including absolute cost declines in some countries and specific eras. Our new findings suggest that there is no inherent cost escalation trend associated with nuclear technology.},

	abstract = {The purpose of this paper is to recommend a break-even point for the capital investment cost for a Sodium-cooled Fast Reactor ({SFR}) when choosing between a Pyro-{SFR} nuclear fuel cycle (recycling option via Pyro-processing) and a direct disposal option. This is because the selection of an alternative cannot be justified without a guarantee of economic feasibility. The calculation of a break-even point is necessary because {SFR} capital investment cost makes up the largest share of the cost for electricity generation. In other words, the cost of capital investment is an important cost driver, and the one that exerts the greatest effect on Pyro-{SFR} nuclear fuel cycle economics. In the end, the break-even point of the {SFR} capital investment cost between the Pyro-{SFR} nuclear fuel cycle and the direct disposal was calculated to be 4284 {US}\$/{kWe}. In other words, it is possible to claim that the potential for the economic viability of the Pyro-{SFR} nuclear fuel cycle is greater (compared to investing in direct disposal) when the {SFR} capital investment cost is 4284 {US}\$/{kWe} or less. In addition, Pyro-{SFR} technology will enable sustainable nuclear power generation.},

	abstract = {As part of its ambitious long term energy strategy, Switzerland plans to phase out nuclear power production and replace most or all of its significant share of national electricity production (40\%) by renewables, in particular by photovoltaics ({PV}) and wind energy. The existing large fraction of hydropower and significant pumped-storage hydro capacity in the mountainous regions of the country will potentially provide valuable balancing and ancillary services for the management of intermittent production from {PV} and wind. We present a set of calculations based on data from the current Swiss electricity system, which investigate the effect of different {PV}-wind mixing ratio scenarios on required import and export from foreign neighbors. It is shown that the current hydropower is a good basis to deal with intermittent energy sources and to keep import rates of electricity at current levels in a fully renewable Switzerland as long as the {PV}-wind ratio is small. For higher {PV}-shares, forced export and import will increase but appear acceptable if {PV}-contribution stays below 0.6. Enlargement of reservoir capacity or oversizing of intermittent renewables can further reduce required import effectively. These findings are quantitatively specific for Switzerland but qualitatively transferable to similar mountainous environments with abundant hydropower resources.},

	abstract = {Carbon Capture and Storage ({CCS}) might be a central technology to reach the decarbonisation goals of the European energy system. However, {CCS} deployment faces multiple economic, technological, and infrastructure challenges. Related literature tends to only focus on certain aspects of the {CCS} technology or to be limited to a particular sector perspective. In contrast, this paper presents a holistic modelling framework to analyse the long-term perspectives of {CCS} in Europe by extending the typical analysis from the electricity sector to the industry sector, and by including the {CO}2 infrastructure level with {CO}2 pipelines and storage. To this end, we use state-of-the-art models of the electricity sector (generation investment and electricity grid models), the industry sector, as well as the {CO}2 infrastructure sector. This unique modelling framework analyses the feasibility and costs of {CCS} deployment in the European Union towards 2050 in three scenarios with the same ambitious climate policy target ( 85\% {CO}2 emissions reduction). The main insights on the deployment of {CCS} in Europe hinges on two factors: i) the development of low-cost power generation technologies with carbon capture (coal and/or gas-fired), and ii) a sufficiently high {CO}2 price to compensate for the costs of deploying the {CO}2 transport infrastructure. Once {CO}2 transport infrastructure is available, {CCS} will be a preferred mitigation option for the industry sector emissions. The joint use of {CO}2 infrastructure by the electricity and the industry sector allows for economies of scale and economies of density. In the long term, {CCS} cannot achieve the 100\% decarbonisation target of the energy sector because the technology can only capture 80–90\% of the {CO}2 emissions of thermal power plants. Moreover, the advantages of {CCS} in terms of energy system costs compared to a system without {CCS} is rather small, in the range of 2\%. It crucially depends on the costs of renewables and the costs of their integration in the electricity grid.},
